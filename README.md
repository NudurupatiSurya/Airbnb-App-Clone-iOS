## Architecture
- The project is divided into multiple modules, each responsible for a specific part of the application, enhancing code organization and scalability.
- MVVM design pattern is used to separate the business logic and data management (Model) from the UI (View), with the ViewModel acting as an intermediary that handles data binding and state management.
